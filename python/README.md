# **Python Learning Journey**  

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This project tracks my progress as I dive into Python, from the basics to more advanced topics like data structures and algorithms.  
Each phase contains examples, notes, and projects to reinforce my learning.

## **Phase 1: Foundations - Learn the Basics**  
In this phase, I cover the fundamentals of Python, including basic syntax, variables, control flow, and core data collections.  
The goal is to build a strong foundation with practical examples and small projects.

## **Phase 2: Data Structures & Algorithms**  
This phase focuses on understanding essential data structures (like lists, dictionaries, arrays) and implementing algorithms (like sorting and recursion).  
I will also work on visualizing algorithms through small interactive projects.
