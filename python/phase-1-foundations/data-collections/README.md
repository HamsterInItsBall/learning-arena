# **Data Collections**

Welcome to the **Data Collections** section!  
In this part of my learning journey, Iâ€™ll explore the most common **data collections** in Python, including **lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries**.  
Iâ€™ll learn how to **store, access, and modify** data using these collections, and Iâ€™ll apply this knowledge by building a **Contact List** project.

## **What I Will Learn in This Section**

### **Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries**
- **Lists**  
  - Ordered, changeable collections of items (e.g., `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`)
- **Tuples**  
  - Ordered, **unchangeable** collections (e.g., `("apple", "banana", "cherry")`)
- **Sets**  
  - Unordered collections with **unique** items (e.g., `{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}`)
- **Dictionaries**  
  - Key-value pairs for **storing structured data** (e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`)

I will explore how to:
- **Create** collections
- **Access** data by index, key, or value
- **Modify** or **update** items in these collections
- **Loop through** collections to work with their data

## **Project: Contact List (CRUD Operations)**

For my final project in this phase, I will build a **Contact List** program that allows me to:
- **Create** new contacts (name, phone number, etc.)
- **Read** (display) all saved contacts
- **Update** existing contact information
- **Delete** contacts

This project will help me practice:
- **Dictionaries** for storing contact details
- **Lists** for managing multiple contacts
- **Loops** and **conditionals** to control the program flow
- **Input and output handling**

## ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**
I will expand this section with examples, notes, and the complete **Contact List** project as I continue learning.
