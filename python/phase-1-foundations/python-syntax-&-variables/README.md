# **Python Syntax & Variables**

Welcome to the **Python Syntax & Variables** section!  
Here, I'll dive into the basics of Python syntax, variables, and different data types.  
I'll also explore control flow, including conditionals and loops, and will build my first small project.

## **What I Will Learn in This Section**

### **[Basic Syntax](./BasicSyntax.md)**
- Understanding how Python code is structured.
- Using **indentation** (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks (no curly braces like in other languages).
- Writing **comments** to explain code for myself and others.

### **[Variables](./Variables.md) and [Data Types](DataTypes.md)**
- Creating and using **variables** to store information.
- Working with different **data types**, such as:
  - **Numbers** (`int`, `float`)
  - **Strings** (`str`)
  - **Booleans** (`True`, `False`)
  - **Lists**, **Tuples**, **Sets**, and **Dictionaries** (covered more deeply in a later section)

### **[Conditionals](./Conditionals.md) and Loops([For](./Loops-For.md);[While](./Loops-While.md))**
- Using **`if`, `elif`, `else`** to make decisions based on conditions.
- Repeating actions with **`for` loops** and **`while` loops**.

## **Project: [Calculator](./Project-Calculator)**

To practice what I’ve learned, I will build a **simple calculator** that can:
- Ask the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, etc.).
- Request two numbers as input.
- Perform the calculation and show the result.

This project will help me apply:
- **Input and output handling**
- **Variables**
- **Conditionals**
- **Loops (if needed)**
