# Phase 1: Foundations - Learn the Basics

Welcome to **Phase 1: Foundations** of my Python learning journey! In this phase, I‚Äôll cover the essential concepts of Python, 
starting with the basics and gradually diving deeper into core syntax, control flow, functions, and data collections. 
The goal of this phase is to build a strong foundation of Python programming that will help me understand more advanced 
topics in later phases.

## üìö [**Introduction to Python**](./introduction-to-python)
In this section, I‚Äôll explore the core idea of Python and why it‚Äôs one of the most popular programming languages. 
I‚Äôll also set up my development environment and run my first Python script.

- **What is Python? Why learn it?**
- **Setting up the environment** (Installing Python, Visual Studio Code, and Git)
- **Running your first script** (First "Hello, World!" script)

## üìù [**Python Syntax & Variables**](./python-syntax-&-variables)
Here, I'll dive into the basics of Python syntax, variables, and different data types. 
I'll also explore control flow, including conditionals and loops, and will build my first small project.

- **Basic Syntax** (Understanding how Python code is structured)
- **Variables and Data Types** (Numbers, Strings, Lists, etc.)
- **Conditionals and Loops** (If statements, While loops, For loops)
- **Project: Calculator** (A simple calculator program to practice what I‚Äôve learned)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Control Flow & Functions**
In this section, I‚Äôll learn about more advanced control flow features like type casting, error handling (exceptions), and functions.
I'll also build another small project to practice using functions and error handling.

- **Type Casting** (Converting between data types)
- **Error Handling (Exceptions)** (How to handle errors and exceptions in Python)
- **Built-in and Custom Functions** (Understanding Python‚Äôs built-in functions and creating my own functions)
- **Project: Greeting Program** (A program that greets the user based on input)

---

## üìä **Data Collections**
This section focuses on essential data collections in Python, such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. 
I‚Äôll explore how to store, modify, and access data in these collections. I'll also work on my final project for this phase.

- **Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries** (Learn about each collection type and its use cases)
- **Project: Contact List** (A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations program using dictionaries and lists)
