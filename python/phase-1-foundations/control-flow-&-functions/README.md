# **Control Flow & Functions**

Welcome to the **Control Flow & Functions** section!  
In this part of my learning journey, Iâ€™ll explore more advanced Python features like **type casting**, **error handling (exceptions)**, and **functions**.  
Iâ€™ll also challenge myself with a small project to apply what Iâ€™ve learned.

---

## **What I Will Learn in This Section**

### **Type Casting**
- **Converting between different data types**, such as:
  - From a **string to an integer** using `int()`
  - From an **integer to a string** using `str()`
- This is useful when working with user input, since `input()` always returns text (a string).

### **Error Handling (Exceptions)**
- Learning how to **handle errors** without crashing the program using:
  - **`try` / `except`** blocks
  - **`else` and `finally`** for additional control
- This helps make my programs more **robust and user-friendly**.

### **Built-in and Custom Functions**
- Understanding and using **Pythonâ€™s built-in functions**, such as:
  - `print()`, `len()`, `input()`, `int()`, `str()`, and more.
- **Writing my own functions** using:
  - `def` keyword
  - Function parameters and return values
- Functions make my code **reusable**, **organized**, and **easier to understand**.

## **Project: Greeting Program**

For this section, I will build a **Greeting Program** that:
- Asks the user for their **name** and **age**.
- Greets the user with a **personalized message**.
- **Handles errors**, such as if the user enters something that isnâ€™t a valid number when asked for their age.

This project will help me apply:
- **Type casting**
- **Error handling**
- **Functions**
- **Input and output handling**

## ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**
I will expand this section with examples, notes, and the full **Greeting Program** as I continue learning.
